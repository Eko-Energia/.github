# 📋 GitHub Repository Guidelines

## 📦 Repository Naming

- Use **English**, lowercase, `kebab-case`
- Be specific and clear (avoid generic names)
- One repository = one project or one board

**✅ Examples:**

- `perla-parameters-monitor`
- `halina-stm-brake`

## 📁 Standard Folder Structure

```
📂project-name/
├── README.md # Required
├── LICENSE # Default: MIT
├── .gitignore
├─📂 src/
│ ├─📂 main/
│ └─📂 test/
├── hardware/  (if applicable)
└── .github  (optional)
```

## 📝 README.md Template

Each repository **must include a README.md** with at least:

### 🔧 Project Name

Short 1–2 sentence description.

### 🚀 Goal (Optional)

What the project aims to achieve. Technologies used. Current status (WIP / complete / testing).

### ▶️ How to Run

Steps to build, install, or run locally.

### 👥 Authors

- Name Surname – role
  
### 📜 License

## 🛠 Git Workflow

### Default branch: main
### Use branches - if you dont work alone !!!

feature/<name> for new features

fix/<name> for bug fixes

### Use Pull Requests for all changes

Write meaningful commit messages:

✅ Add PWM control logic

❌ update

## 🧙 Best Practices
Keep code clear and **consistent**

Keep README.md up to date

**Review code and don`t leave mess**
